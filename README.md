Matlab code to enhance image quality by using following techniques-Low pass and weighted low pass filter, Median filter, Laplacian mask & Composite Mask.

THEORY PART-
1)LOW PASS FILTER-
  A Low Pass Filter is a circuit that can be designed to modify, reshape or reject all unwanted high frequencies of an electrical signal and accept or pass only those signals      wanted by the circuits designer.

2)Laplacian mask-
  A Laplacian filter is an edge detector used to compute the second derivatives of an image, measuring the rate at which the first derivatives change. This determines if a change  in adjacent pixel values is from an edge or continuous progression.
  
3)COMPOSITE MASK-
   Composite images to create new images. Composite is the base image and image contains the changes. composited is the result, and normally has the same dimensions as composite. The optional mask can be used to provide matte information for composite when it has none or if you want a different mask. A mask image is typically grayscale and the same size as composite. If mask is not grayscale, it is converted to grayscale and the resulting intensities are used as matte information.

4)MEDIAN FILTER-
  Median filtering is a nonlinear operation often used in image processing to reduce "salt and pepper" noise. A median filter is more effective than convolution when the goal is to simultaneously reduce noise and preserve edges.
